                                                    1000 Genomes Project was initiated in 2008 with an objective to provide in-depth understanding and characterization of human genome sequence variation for investigating relationship between genotype and phenotype. The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project is to find most genetic variants that have frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied.  The reference human genome sequence provides a foundation for the study of human genetics, but systematic investigation of human variation requires full knowledge of DNA sequence variation across the entire spectrum of allele frequencies and types of DNA differences.

                                                    Substantial progress has been already made in the development of dbSNP database which includes approximately 11 million SNPs and 3 million short indels. Recent studies revealed genetic variants across 26 populations having 2504 individuals.  In this work, a total of 4 super populations have been taken into account viz.,  African (AFR), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR) and South Asian (SAS).  ~88 million variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions/deletions and structural variants across global samples) have been catalogued so far by 1000 genomes project. It also provided a key component for human genetic studies, by enabling array design, genotype imputation, cataloging of variants in regions of interest, and filtering of likely neutral variants.

It has emerged as one of the leading databases due to its dynamic schema, high scalability, optimal query performance, faster indexing and an active user community.
                                                    <br/>
                                                    The JSON class has methods for parsing JSON documents. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.

The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project is to find most genetic variants that have frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied.  The reference human genome sequence provides a foundation for the study of human genetics, but systematic investigation of human variation requires full knowledge of DNA sequence variation across the entire spectrum of allele frequencies and types of DNA differences.

Recent studies revealed genetic variants across 26 populations having 2504 individuals.  In this work, a total of 4 super populations have been taken into account viz.,  African (AFR), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR) and South Asian (SAS).  ~88 million variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions/deletions and structural variants across global samples) have been catalogued so far by 1000 genomes project. It also provided a key component for human genetic studies, by enabling array design, genotype imputation, cataloging of variants in regions of interest, and filtering of likely neutral variants.
