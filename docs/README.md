# What is Gamut

**GAMUT** - Platform for addressing high throughput analysis and management of variant data produced by Next Generation Sequencing techniques.

## Features
- **Accelerated Search** : Speed and Optimization is a key attributes for any search, Gamut enabled with this feature for large genomic database.
- **Graphical Result** : Graphical result displays the results in different graphical formats. Graphical results are displayed in the form of bar and pie diagrams.
- **Big data Solution** : MongoDB is used at backend for support as a big data database solution for life sciences data. MongoDB supports GAMUT at backend.
- **Variant Comparison** : SNP associations may help to predict an individual’s response to certain drugs, susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, risk of developing particular diseases and used to track the inheritance of disease genes within families.
- **1000 Genome data** : The International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) was established to ensure the ongoing usability of data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project and to extend the data set. IGSR provides open data to support the community’s research efforts.
- **Graphical Result** : Graphical result displays the results in different graphical formats. Graphical results are displayed in the form of bar and pie diagrams.
- **Visualization** : The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high- performance visualization tool for interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic.
